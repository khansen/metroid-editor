enjoyment of the program, make sure to read this help file thoroughly.

Game map

The areas in Metroid are built up of several "rooms" (a room = one NES
screen, 256x240 pixels in size), which are chained together to form larger
shafts and corridors. The internal game map basically tells which room to
display at each map position. In the main editor window, you move around on
the map by using the arrow keys. When you want to see exactly where you are
on the map, or get to a certain spot in the game quickly, enter the map
editor from the Tools menu. (More info on the map editor later.)

Editing room objects

Each room consists of a certain number of objects. In order to
manipulate an object, you have to select the object to edit. To
do this, point at the desired object, then click and hold the
left mouse button. To change the object's position, simply move
the mouse. To change the object type, click the right mouse button
repeatedly until you find the desired type. Hold the Shift key
while doing so to go backwards through the available object types.
Press spacebar repeatedly to cycle through the 4 4-color palettes that
the object can use.

The objects are drawn in the order in which they appear in the
room data, thus giving each object a unique priority. This can
be used to make one object appear partially or completely behind
another object.

Editing enemies

You edit enemies just like you edit room objects: Select the desired
enemy and manipulate it as desired according to the description above.
Pressing spacebar now toggles between the normal edition and the "hard-type"
edition of the enemy. The "hard-type" edition is twice as powerful is
the normal edition.

You can change what room to display at a certain map position by using
the -/+ keys.

Status bar

The status bar describes the current editing process. When an object isn't
selected for editing, the current map position and the room number at this
position is displayed. When you click on an object, the status bar will
display relevant info about the object.

Map Editor

Your current position on the map is indicated by a white cursor. You
can move around on the map with the arrow keys, just like in the
main editor window, but you can also use the left mouse button to
select the map position you wish to go to. The color of a certain
map position specifies which area it is part of. Color codes are as
follows:

Blue    -       Brinstar
Green   -       Norfair
Red     -       Tourian
Purple  -       Kraid's Hideout
Cyan    -       Ridley's Hideout

Some of the map positions are black, meaning that they are currently
unused in the game; Samus can't go there. Such positions can be
activated simply by pressing the left mouse button on the position
you want to activate. The area code of a certain map position can be
changed by clicking on that position with the right mouse button.
Press repeatedly to cycle through the 5 different area codes. If you
want to remove an active map position, select that position, then
press Delete.

When you save the changes to your Metroid ROM, MetEdit saves the area
codes for all the map positions to a file named "metedit.map", and
this file is automatically loaded the next time you load the ROM.
MetEdit needs this info to know what room data to associate with
each map position, since this can't be retrieved directly from the
ROM without actually running the game. This means that if you change
an area code on the map through the map editor, you have to be sure
that when this map position is accessed _when the game is actually
played_, the proper ROM bank is already loaded into $8000. For
example, if you change the area code at the position where you begin
in Brinstar from Blue to Red (Tourian), MetEdit will think that this
map position is actually part of Tourian - which it isn't.

Item Editor

Select the area you wish to edit from the first listbox, and the item
you want to change in the box below it. To change the map position of a
selected special item, simply click on the desired position on the map
to the right.

Palette Editor

The palette editor lets you change the colors of the background objects
and enemies in the game. The area palettes are arranged in 4-color
groups. (Each object can't have more than 4 different colors -
actually only 3, because color #0 of each palette is transparent.)
In the upper left portion of the window are the 4 background palettes
in descending order, and to the right of them are the sprite palettes.
The currently selected palette entry is indicated by a white cursor.
Below the game palettes are all the available NES colors. To change a
palette entry, simply click on the desired entry, then click on the
desired NES color.

Password Creator

The password is generated based on which item boxes are checked in the
item list. There are some item descriptions missing; if you figure out
the meaning of some of the unknown bits, please send a brief description
to me. Some of the password bits are maybe not used at all, though.

You can also decode an existing password by entering it in the space next
to the "Decode" button, then clicking that button. This will check the
appropriate boxes in the item list according to the password data.

A note about the game's starting point: Check both the "Norfair" and
"Kraid's Hideout" box to begin in Tourian.
